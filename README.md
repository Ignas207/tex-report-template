# LaTex work report template

This is a standart template for various reports that I use.

# Dependancies

- If compiling locally on Windows I recommend to use MikTex:
   - `winget install StrawberryPerl.StrawberryPerl MiKTeX.MiKTeX`
   - Perl is a dependancy that also needs to be installed!

- To make tables easier to make, use [excel2latex](./dependancies/excel2latex/README.md)
